inspired by applications like
[Backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage),[Homepage](https://github.com/benphelps/homepage)
and [Port](https://www.getport.io/)
this project wants to create a place where different types of jobs in the same
company finds all the content necessary in a easy, productive and nice way.

## Why this?
I always have a problem when a new employer enters in the company trying to
remember all the accesses i have to give, shows all the links we have and where
is th documentations projects and etc, make te onboard in always problematic,
and if they works in another area which is not tech related stuff, it becomes
even harder, so you already imagine this project purpose.

## Ideas
- [] HomePage customization per machine or user (still don't know for sure)
- [] HomePage default theme by position
- [] RBAC
- [] Widget scheme
- [] Theme scheme
- [] command system [something like this](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page)
- [] search system (sevices, cluster, commands)
- [] event notification system (for observability, e.g. payment system out of air)


## start project.

If you are using nix as a package manager you will need direnv only and run
command `direnv allow`, otherwise you should use container.
